# AI Specifications Creation for Conversational Interface

## Executive Summary

This document records the creation of new specifications for the AI-powered conversational interface features, following the established patterns and constitutional requirements of the existing specification system. The new specs maintain consistency with the existing structure while extending the system with AI capabilities.

## Specification Structure Created

### New Directories Created
- `/specs/agents/conversation-agent/` - Complete specification for AI conversation agent
- `/specs/mcp-tools/task-operations/` - Complete specification for MCP task operation tools
- `/specs/api/chat-api/` - Complete specification for chat API endpoint
- `/specs/database/conversation-model/` - Complete specification for conversation/message data models
- `/specs/ui/chatkit/` - Complete specification for chat UI component

### Files Created in Each Directory
- `spec.md` - Functional and technical specifications
- `plan.md` - Implementation plan with phases and dependencies
- `tasks.md` - Detailed task breakdown with priorities and dependencies
